!Series_summary = Brain metastases represent a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with limited therapeutic options. The unique brain microenvironment, characterized by low lipid availability, may drive metastatic NSCLC cells to adapt through lipid metabolic reprogramming. In this study, we identify a novel mechanism in NSCLC brain colonization mediated by IGF2BP3-driven lipid metabolism. Elevated IGF2BP3 expression in NSCLC brain colonization correlates with poor prognosis and promotes cancer cell migration, invasion, and brain colonization by activating the lipogenesis pathway. Our findings highlight the critical role of IGF2BP3 in lipid metabolism and propose that targeting IGF2BP3 may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for NSCLC brain metastases.
